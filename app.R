           are at recognizing and exploiting opponent weakpoints mid-game, by drawing
           up quick hitters such as quick slips, hammer actions, etc. My goal of this
           project was to explore if teams with high PPP rates on ATOs in the regular
           season maintained those rates in the postseason, and if there was any
           association between regular season ATO PPP and playoff success.",

             I calculated the league average ATO PPP rate for each indivudal regular season
             and postseaso. Since the variance of ATO PPP is relatively small,
             teams were categorized as above average or below average to give a 
             better idea of how each team performed relative to the rest of the league
             in that stretch. Since playoff PPP and wins were comparison metrics,
             only teams that made the playoffs in a given year are included on the 
             plots There are some interesting takeways from the visualizations.
             One being that every team that has reached the NBA Finals in the 
             past decade was above average in regular season ATO PPP in the corresponding 
             regular season. This suggets that being able to efficiently convert ATO
             opportunities bodes well for teams in the playoffs, as opponents really
             dig into team's playbooks and sets, forcing on-the-fly adjustments. There
             was not a strong relationship between regular season and postseason ATO PPP,
             however. This may have been a result of differently sized samples, since
             some teams only play 4 playoff games compared to 82 regular season ones.
             These first round exit teams may have skewed the data, since some 
             were hyperefficient on relatively fewer possessions than teams that made
             deep playoff runs (e.g. the 2014-15 Charlotte Hornets).",
